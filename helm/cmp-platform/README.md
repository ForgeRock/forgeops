# cmp-platform - sample composite chart for use with the Quick Start Guide only

This chart is a simple example that lets you deploy the ForgeRock Identity 
 Platform, and is for use when working through the example in the *DevOps Quick 
 Start Guide* only.  

For all other deployments, install individual Helm charts as described in the 
 *DevOps Developer's Guide*.

 If you make changes to any of the dependent charts you must run `helm dep up cmp-platform`.

 If you are new to using helm and forgeops, it is recommended that you deploy the charts one at a time, and
 validate that each component is working correctly before proceeding to the next one.
