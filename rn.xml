    <h2>
     Terraform for CDM cluster creation and deletion
    </h2>
    <p>
     Use Terraform to create clusters in which you can install the CDM.
     Terraform artifacts are now available in the top-level `terraform`
     directory of the new `forgeops-extras` repository. Install Terraform software
     before you install the CDM to take advantage of this new capability.
    </p>
    <p>
     The `cluster-up.sh` and `cluster-down.sh` scripts are no
     longer available. Use Terraform for cluster creation and deletion instead.
    </p>
