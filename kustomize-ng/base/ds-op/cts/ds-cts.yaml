    # using kubectl exec.

    # Examples of setting environment variables:
    #
    # 1. Set DS_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATION_SERVERS to override the default bootstrap
    # for a multi-cluster deployment. This example overrides the default bootstrap for a
    # GCP MultiCluster deployment for a "ds-cts" instance by specifying one bootstrap server
    # in this cluster (eu) and a second bootstrap server in the us cluster. The DNS names
    # in the value must be fully resolvable on all clusters. The namespaces must be identical
    # in all clusters.
    #
    # - name: DS_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATION_SERVERS
    #   value: "ds-cts-0.ds-cts.mynamespace.svc.eu:8989,ds-cts-0.ds-cts.mynamespace.svc.us:8989"
    #
    # See the README in forgeops/ds/ds-new. Understand what you are doing before setting this variable!
    #
    # 2. Set DS_GROUP_ID to indicate that we are in the eu region. The group ID is appended to the
    # hostname to ensure that the server has a unique identity within the Directory Service topology.
    # - name: DS_GROUP_ID
    #   value: "eu"

    ### End Pod Template ###

  # Optional - Configures the operator to automatically take snapshots
  # You must be using a CSI volume driver. CSI drivers are now the default on GCP clusters.
  # For more information on CSI drivers, see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi
  snapshots:
    enabled: false
    # Take a snapshot every N minutes. The number here is low for testing.
    # On a production cluster, you should set this to something higher (20-30 minutes).
    # Note that GCP snapshots are quota limited to 6 per hour per disk.
    periodMinutes: 10
    # Keep this many snapshots. Older snapshots will be deleted
    snapshotsRetained: 3
    # DS instance to take snapshot of. Default is 0(ds-idrepo-0).
    # For deployment with multiple ds-idrepo servers, change this to a non primary ds-idrepo server(e.g. 1).
    # directoryInstance: 0

  ### Passwords ###
  # Passwords: maps DS accounts to new or existing secrets.
  # The operator supports "bring your own secrets". For example, a secret may have been generated by another operator such as secret agent.
  # A secret that does not set create: true is assumed to be supplied externally. External secrets will not be deleted by the operator
  passwords:
    # uid=admin and uid=monitor are required account secrets.
    uid=admin:
      secretName: ds-passwords
      key: dirmanager.pw
    uid=monitor:
      secretName: ds-passwords
      key: monitor.pw
      # example of letting the operator generate the secret:
      #create: true

    # Set the service account passwords
    uid=openam_cts,ou=admins,ou=famrecords,ou=openam-session,ou=tokens:
      secretName: ds-env-secrets
      key: AM_STORES_CTS_PASSWORD
    # An example where the operator should generate a password
    # uid=test,ou=admins,ou=test:
    #   secretName: my-secret
    #   key: test.pw
    #   create: true
