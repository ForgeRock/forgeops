# This primes the idrepo datastore with the required base policy entries in ou=am-config
# AM does not yet dynamically create the realm policy entries when it attaches to a new dynamic config
# store - as is the case with File Based Config.
# This procedure concatenates the profiles for the base config store, the base external datastore and
# The alpha/bravo realms.
# This work was previously performed at runtime by the ldif loader. This moves it to a docker build time
# activity. The profiles will create the prototype configs which are used to prime the PVC.
#
# This can be removed once AM can create these itself. See https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/AME-19010
