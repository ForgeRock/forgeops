# Framework config properties.
#

# To override the packages the framework exports by default from the
# class path, set this variable.
#org.osgi.framework.system.packages=

# To append packages to the default set of exported system packages,
# set this value.
org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra=sun.misc,org.forgerock.openidm.launcher,sun.security.pkcs11,com.sun.management.comm,com.sun.management.snmp,com.sun.management.snmp.agent,com.sun.nio.file

# The following property makes specified packages from the class path
# available to all bundles. You should avoid using this property.
org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=sun.*,com.sun.*,apple.*,com.apple.*,javax.net.ssl,javax.xml.*,jdk.internal.*

# Felix tries to guess when to implicitly boot delegate in certain
# situations to ease integration without outside code. This feature
# is enabled by default, uncomment the following line to disable it.
#felix.bootdelegation.implicit=false

# The following property explicitly specifies the location of the bundle
# cache, which defaults to "felix-cache" in the current working directory.
# If this value is not absolute, then the felix.cache.rootdir controls
# how the absolute location is calculated. (See buildNext property)
#org.osgi.framework.storage=&{felix.cache.rootdir|&{user.dir}}/felix-cache

# The following property controls whether the bundle cache is flushed
# the first time the framework is initialized. Possible values are
# "none" and "onFirstInit"; the default is "none".
org.osgi.framework.storage.clean=onFirstInit

# framework.service.urlhandlers - specifies whether or not to activate the URL Handlers
# service for the framework newBuilder; the default value is "true",
# which results in the URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory() and
# URLConnection.setContentHandlerFactory() being called.

# felix.log.level - specifies an integer String whose value indicates the degree of
# logging reported by the framework; the default value is "1" and "0" turns off logging completely,
# otherwise log levels match those specified in the OSGi Log Service
# (i.e., 1 = error, 2 = warning, 3 = information, and 4 = debug).
# We log osgi entries via a log listener, and hence default the internal logging service logging to off
felix.log.level=0

# Sets the initial start level of the framework upon startup.
org.osgi.framework.startlevel.beginning=12

# Sets the start level of newly installed bundles.
felix.startlevel.bundle=10

# Felix installs a stream and content handler factories by default,
# uncomment the following line to not install them.
#felix.service.urlhandlers=false

# The launcher registers a shutdown hook to cleanly stop the framework
# by default, uncomment the following line to disable it.
#felix.shutdown.hook=false
