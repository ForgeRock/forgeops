# Forgeops Production Deployment Sample

### What is in this sample?
Shell scripts and custom values that facilitate the deployment of the ForgeRock platform in a production-like scenerio using (overlaying) the forgeops project.  All you have to do is run the `forgeops/bin/deploy.sh` script as specified below in the "Usage" section, sit back and relax.  

### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have access to Kubernetes cluster as described above and permissions to do deployments.  
Other requirements are:
 - kubectl is fully functional
 - You have an existing cluster, context and proper permissions/roles
 - Helm is installed (Kubernetes package manager) with RBAC
 - Ingress is deployed and you can access the cluster endpoint
 - You have `curl` binary installed
 - You have modified `*.yaml` files in `samples/config/<directory>` to cater to your environment.


### Choosing the Deployment Size

- The subdirectories contain custom values for deployments of two sizes.  The small `s-cluster` is recommended for upto 1M users whereas the medium `m-cluster` is recommended for upto 10M users. It is highly recommended to have 4 vCPU and 16GB RAM per node for the small cluster and 16vCPU and 64GB RAM per node for the medium cluster. Otherwise the deployment **could fail**. 

- The cluster should at least have 2 nodes in the primary zone. If HA is desired then either add 2 more nodes to the primary zone or add addtional zone(s).  See the HA section below for more details on multi-zone deployment.  The `s-cluster` and `m-cluster` samples are already designed for 2 zone HA.

- Note: You can also use the `forgeops/bin/<provider>-up.sh` script to create a new cluster. For example `gke-up.sh` 

> **Caution:** The sizing done in these samples is for guidance only and while it is a good starting point, you are requried to benchmark and size with your own data and use cases.


### HA and Multi-Zone deployments
- If you need HA for a single zone cluster then comment out the *openamReplicaCount* and *replicas* keys in each of the corresponding yaml file.  Set the value to the desired number but make sure that your node is sized appropiately to support the number.  Also ensure the value of `ctsStores` and `ctsPassword` is accurate in amster.yaml.

- If you need HA for multi-zone cluster then comment out the *topologyKey* in each of the yaml files.  See `s-cluser` and `m-cluster` yaml files as an example.

- Regional HA is not supported yet by this sample. 


### Usage

The `deploy.sh` script needs to point to a "config" directory.  There are several "config" examples provided under the `forgeops/samples` directory.  If you choose to use the existing samples, then all you have to do is to execute `./deploy.sh <path to config directory>`. For example `./deploy.sh ../samples/config/prod/m-cluster`

The deployment will take anywhere from 3-10 minutes so be patient. For a successful deployment you will get a message saying "Deployment is now ready"

Check out the CDM Cookbook in the ForgeRock documentation for more details.

### Notes
It's normal to see these errors repeated 4 or 5 times in the beginning of the deployment
```
Error from server (BadRequest): container "amster" in pod "amster-XXXXXXXXX-xxxxx" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
Configuration not finished yet. Waiting for 10 seconds....
```
If you continue to see a lot of these then check the pod by running
```
kubectl describe pod amster-XXXXXXXXX-xxxxx
```
