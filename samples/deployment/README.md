# Forgeops Deployment

### What is in this sample?
Shell scripts and custom values that facilitate the deployment of the ForgeRock platform in a production-like scenerio using (overlaying) the forgeops project.  All you have to do is run the ```deploy.sh``` script and sit back.  


### Deployment Sizing

- Under the `type` directory there are subdirectories which contain custom values for deployments of two sizes.  The small `s-cluster` is recommended for upto 1M users whereas the medium `m-cluster` is recommended for upto 10M users. It is highly recommended to have 8 vCPU and 20GB RAM per node for the small cluster and 16vCPU and 40GB RAM per node for the medium cluster. Otherwise the deployment **will fail**. 

- The cluster should have at least 2 nodes per zone if HA is not desired or 4 nodes per zone if HA is desired. If you need zone HA then the other zones should mirror the primary zone.

- Note: You can also use the `forgeops/bin/gke-up.sh` script to create a new cluster.  

> **Caution:** The sizing done in these samples is for guidance only and while it is a good starting point, you are requried to benchmark and size with your own data and use cases.


### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have access to Kubernetes cluster as described above and permissions to do deployments.  
Other requirements are:
 - kubectl is fully functional
 - You have an existing cluster and context
 - Helm is installed (Kubernetes package manager)
 - Ingress is deployed and you can access the cluster endpoint
 - You have edited the variables in `deploy.sh` to your environment
 - You have edited  `type/[cluster-size]/amster.yaml` and modified the sedFilter to your environment. Example follows. 
 
```
global:
  git:
    sedFilter: "-e s/benchmark.example.com/[NAMESPACE].[DOMAIN]/"
```


### HA and Multi-Zone deployments
- If you need HA for a single zone cluster then comment out the *openamReplicaCount* and *replicas* keys in each of the yaml file in the `templates` directory.  Set the value to the desired number but make sure that your node is sized appropiately to support the number.

- If you need HA for multi-zone cluster then comment out the *topologyKey* in each of the yaml files. 


### Usage

The `deploy.sh` script can take command line arguments or you can edit the script itself and change the variables at the top.  If you change the variables then all you have to do is to execute `./deploy.sh`

Alternatively you can provide the variables via command-line switches and hence there is no need to edit the script. For information about the switches, run the script with the --help option.

The deployment will take anywhere from 3-10 minutes so be patient. For a successful deployment you will get a message saying "Deployment is now ready"


### Notes
It's normal to see these errors repeated 4 or 5 times in the beginning of the deployment
```
Error from server (BadRequest): container "amster" in pod "amster-XXXXXXXXX-xxxxx" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
Configuration not finished yet. Waiting for 10 seconds....
```
If you continue to see a lot of these then check the pod by running
```
kubectl describe pod amster-XXXXXXXXX-xxxxx
```
