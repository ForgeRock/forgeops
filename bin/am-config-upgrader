# Run the am-config upgrade process on AM FBC configuration files.
#
# The default rules upgrade AM configuration to the same version as the upgrader image itself. For
# example, if the upgrader docker image is version 7.2.1, AM FBC files will be upgraded to 7.2.1.
#
# Usage: bin/am-upgrader [am-fbc-files] [rules-directory]
#  [am-fbc-files] is the directory that contains the exported AM FBC Files. This defaults to docker/7.0/am.
#   This script assumes FBC files have been previously exported.
#
#  If [rules-directory] is not provided, the version upgrade rules bundled in the image will be used. Otherwise
#  the rules found in this directory will be run.
#
#
# You can change the version of the upgrader used by supplying the REPO and TAG environment variables.
# For example:
# TAG=7.0.3 bin/am-config-upgrader
