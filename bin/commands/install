The install command is deprecated.  We have replaced it with the apply command
to more accurately represent the fact that all we are doing now is a \`kubectl
apply -k /path/to/overlay\`. We encourage folks to use the kubectl command
instead of \`forgeops-ng apply\`.

For more information:
forgeops apply -h

Running the following apply command for you.

EOM

ARGS=("$@") # Create an array out of our arguments

# Enable debugging so runOrPrint will always print the command before running it
DEBUG=true

runOrPrint $SCRIPT_DIR/../forgeops-ng apply ${ARGS[*]}
