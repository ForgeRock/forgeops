The generate command is deprecated. It was used to craft an overlay in the
kustomize/deploy directory. We have replaced it with an environment management
command that can create and update discrete overlays for your environments.

The env command requires you to specify an overlay to manage. If you did
not use -l/--overlay when calling this, the default of demo will be added to
the arguments.

For more information:
forgeops env -h

Running the following env command for you.

EOM

ARG=("$@") # Create an array out of our arguments
ENV_ARGS=("-l" "--overlay")

if ! containsElements ${ENV_ARGS[@]} ${ARG_ARRAY[@]} ; then
  ARGS+=("--overlay demo")
fi

# Enable debugging so runOrPrint will always print the command before running it
DEBUG=true

runOrPrint $SCRIPT_DIR/../forgeops env ${ARGS[*]}
