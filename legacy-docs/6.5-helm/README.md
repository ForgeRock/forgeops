# Legacy Documentation 

This folder contains the documentation for deploying the CDM and the DevOps 
examples using Helm charts.   

Deployment using Helm charts is deprecated. We strongly recommend that you move
to the newer, Skaffold- and Kustomize-based workflows described in current
versions of the documentation as soon as possible.
