## ForgeRock Identity Platform Configuration

The provided configuration, which we call the Cloud Developer's Kit (CDK),
is a basic installation that can be further extended by developers to meet their requirements. 
The configuration provides the following features:

* Deployments for ForgeRock AM, IDM, DS and IG. IG is not deployed by default, but is available optionally.
* AM configured with a single root realm.
* A number of OIDC clients configured for AM/IDM integration and for smoke tests.
Note that the `idm-provisioning`, `idm-admin-ui` and the `end-user-ui` client configurations are required for the
integration of IDM and AM.
* Directory service instances configured for:
   * The shared AM/IDM repo (ds-idrepo).
   * The AM dynamic runtime data store for polices and agents. Currently, the ds-idrepo is used.
   * The Access Manager Core Token Service (ds-cts).
* A Gatling test harness, which exercises the basic deployment and can be modified to include additional tests.


## Getting Started

If you just want to observe the ForgeRock Identity Platform in action
on a Kubernetes cluster, you can try out the CDK deployment. 
You'll need to install the required third-party software, set up a
Kubernetes cluster, and deploy the ForgeRock Identity Platform. 

See the [CDK documentation](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/cdk/overview.html) 
for detailed information about all these tasks.

## Accessing Platform UIs and APIs

Details [here](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/cdk/access.html).

## Managing Configurations

ForgeRock uses the `config.sh` script to manage configurations. See [here](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/cdk/develop/intro.html) for more information.

## New CDK

In version 7.1, the new `cdk` is introduced, using the new `cdk` you can manage
configurations and the entire deployment and management workflow. For more
information on the new `cdk`, see the 
[New Cloud Developer’s Kit Documentation](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/previews/new-cdk/overview.html).

## Secrets

ForgeRock uses secrets generated by [Secret Agent Operator](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/deployment/security/secret-agent.html).
 

## Troubleshooting Tips

See the [troubleshooting page](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/troubleshooting/overview.html)
