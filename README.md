## Branches

The master branch targets
features that are still in development and may not be stable. Please checkout the 
 branch that matches the targeted release.


For example, if you have the source checked out from git:

```bash
git checkout release/x.y.0 
```


## Contents 

* docker/ -  contains the Dockerfiles for the various containers.
* helm/ - contains Kubernetes helm charts to deploy those containers. See the helm/README.md
* etc/ - contains various scripts and utilities
* bin/  - Utility shell scripts to deploy the helm charts and create and manage clusters.

## Docker images 

See the [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for instructions on how to build your own docker images.

## Documentation 

The [Draft ForgeRock DevOps Guide](https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/platform/devops-guide/index.html)
tracks the master branch.

The documentation for the current release can be found on 
[backstage](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform).

## Sample Session

* Knowledge of Kubernetes and Helm is assumed. Please read
the [helm documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/index.md) before proceeding.
* This assumes minikube is running (8G of RAM), and helm and kubectl are installed.
* cert-manager must be installed (use the helm chart)
* See bin/setup.sh and bin/minikube-up.sh for sample scripts.

```sh

cd helm/

# Sample that brings up domain .example.com
helm install -f my-custom.yaml frconfig
helm install amster
helm install --set instance=configstore ds
helm install openam


#Get your minikube ip
minikube ip

# You can put DNS entries in an entry in /etc/hosts. For example:
# 192.168.99.100 login.default.example.com openidm.default.example.com openig.default.example.com

open https://login.default.example.com

```

## Helm values.yaml overrides.

The individual charts all have parmeters which you can override to control the deployment. For example,
setting the domain FQDN. 

Please refer to the chart README.md files.


## Setting a namespace

If you do not want to use the 'default' namespace, set your namespace using:

kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>

The `kubectx` and `kubens` utilities are recommended.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the toubleshooting chapter in the [DevOps Guide](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/6/devops-guide/#chap-devops-troubleshoot).

Troubleshooting Suggestions:

* The script bin/debug-log.sh will generate an HTML file with log output. Useful for troubleshooting.
* Simplify. Deploy a single helm chart at a time (for example, opendj), and make sure that chart is working correctly before deploying the next chart. The `bin/deploy.sh` script and the cmp-platform composite charts are provided as a convenience, but can make it more difficult to narrow down an issue in a single chart. 
* Describe a failing pod using `kubectl get pods; kubectl describe pod pod-xxx`
    1. Look at the event log for failures. For example, the image can't be pulled.
    2. Examine all the init containers. Did each init container complete with a zero (success) exit code? If not, examine the logs from that failed init container using `kubectl logs pod-xxx -c init-container-name`
    3. Did the main container enter a crashloop? Retrieve the logs using `kubectl logs pod-xxx`.
    4. Did a docker image fail to be pulled?  Check for the correct docker image name and tag. If you are using a private registry, verify your image pull secret is correct.
    5. You can use `kubectl logs -p pod-xxx` to examine the logs of previous (exited) pods.
* If the pods are coming up successfully, but you can't reach the service, you likely have ingress issues:
    1. Use `kubectl describe ing` and `kubectl get ing ingress-name -o yaml` to view the ingress object.
    2. Describe the service using `kubectl get svc; kubectl describe svc xxx`.  Does the service have an `Endpoint:` binding? If the service endpoint binding is not present, it means the service did not match any running pods.
* Determine if your cluster is having issues (not enough memory, failing nodes). Watch for pods killed with OOM (Out of Memory). Commands to check:
    1. `kubectl describe node`
    2. `kubectl get events -w`
* Most images provide the ability to exec into the pod using bash, and examine processes and logs.  Use `kubectl exec pod-name -it bash`.
* If you wish to backup the directory server, the Kubernetes cluster must support a read-write-many (RWX) volume type, such as NFS, or Minikube's hostpath provisioner. You can describe persistent volumes using `kubectl describe pvc`. If a PVC is in a pending state, your cluster may not support the required storage class.
