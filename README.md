# Deploying with ForgeOps

_Kubernetes deployment for the Ping Identity Platform._

This repository provides Docker, Kustomize and Helm artifacts as well as custom tooling to help users deploy the 
Ping Identity Platform on a Kubernetes cluster. 

## Pre-release software

See [About the forgeops repository](https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/start/repositories.html) in the ForgeOps documentation for information about how to work with the latest pre-release software.

>Note: The forgeops repositoryâ€™s dev branch contains pre-release software that is not supported by Ping Identity.

## What's new?

See the [ForgeOps Release Notes](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.5/rn/rn.html) to read about new features and changes.

## Ping Identity platform configuration

The default product configuration bundled with the product images is a basic installation that can be further extended by developers 
to meet their requirements. 
The main features of the default configuration are:

* Deployments for PingAM, PingIDM, PingDS and PingGateway. PingGateway is not deployed by default, but is available optionally.
* PingAM configured with a single root realm.
* A number of OIDC clients configured for PingAM/PingIDM integration and for smoke tests.
Note that the `idm-provisioning`, `idm-admin-ui` and the `end-user-ui` client configurations are required for the
integration of PingIDM and PingAM.
* Directory service instances configured for:
   * The shared PingAM/PingIDM repo (ds-idrepo).
   * The Ping dynamic runtime data store for policies and agents. Currently, ds-idrepo is used.
   * The Ping Core Token Service (ds-cts).

## Getting Started

If you just want to observe the Ping Identity Platform in action on a 
Kubernetes cluster, you can try out our ForgeOps deployment. You'll need to install 
the required third-party software, set up a Kubernetes cluster, and install the 
Ping Identity Platform. 

See the [Setup](https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/setup/overview.html) and [Deployment](https://ea.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/deploy/overview.html) sections in the documentation for detailed information about all these tasks.
