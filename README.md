## ForgeRock Identity Platform Configuration

The provided configuration, which we call the Cloud Developer's Kit (CDK),
is a basic installation that can be further extended by developers to meet their requirements. 
The main features of the CDK configuration are:

* Deployments for ForgeRock AM, IDM, DS and IG. IG is not deployed by default, but is available optionally.
* AM configured with a single root realm.
* A number of OIDC clients configured for AM/IDM integration and for smoke tests.
Note that the `idm-provisioning`, `idm-admin-ui` and the `end-user-ui` client configurations are required for the
integration of IDM and AM.
* Directory service instances configured for:
   * The shared AM/IDM repo (ds-idrepo).
   * The AM dynamic runtime data store for polices and agents. Currently, the ds-idrepo is used.
   * The Access Manager Core Token Service (ds-cts).
* A Gatling test harness, which exercises the basic deployment and can be modified to include additional tests.


## Getting Started

If you just want to observe the ForgeRock Identity Platform in action on a 
Kubernetes cluster, you can try out our CDK deployment. You'll need to install 
the required third-party software, set up a Kubernetes cluster, and install the 
ForgeRock Identity Platform. 

See the [CDK documentation] for detailed information about all these tasks.
