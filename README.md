## Ping Identity platform configuration

The default product configuration bundled with the product images is a basic installation that can be further extended by developers 
to meet their requirements. 
The main features of the default configuration are:

* Deployments for PingAM, PingIDM, PingDS and PingGateway. PingGateway is not deployed by default, but is available optionally.
* PingAM configured with a single root realm.
* A number of OIDC clients configured for PingAM/PingIDM integration and for smoke tests.
Note that the `idm-provisioning`, `idm-admin-ui` and the `end-user-ui` client configurations are required for the
integration of PingIDM and PingAM.
* Directory service instances configured for:
   * The shared PingAM/PingIDM repo (ds-idrepo).
   * The Ping dynamic runtime data store for policies and agents. Currently, ds-idrepo is used.
   * The Ping Core Token Service (ds-cts).

## Getting Started

the required third-party software, set up a Kubernetes cluster, and install the 
Ping Identity Platform.
